Finally plugged my Kinect into my computer to try [Skanect](http://skanect.occipital.com/). It's really cool, and amazingly, it's almost as easy to use as their web page makes it out to be.

The one difficulty I encountered was Tristan's dark hair; the sensor kept loosing tracking on the back of his head. Next time, better lighting!

Then some fun with [Meshlab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/)- removing the head from this model of a [wizzard on Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7202) and glueing on Tristan's.

Though in my excitement I made a key mistake- see if you can spot it.
