Got [Octoprint](http://octoprint.org/) running on [Arch for the Seagate Dockster](http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv5/seagate-dockstar).

Now the printer can be completely remote controlled and monitored- Octoprint includes instructions for setting up a webcam to both record and stream the print.
