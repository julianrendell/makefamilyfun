I love wood. I love warm sunsets. I love being near water. And it's all better when in a beautiful heritage building with glittering live classical guitar.

I'm sitting in the Chinese Bunkhouse at the Britannia Shipyards National Historic Site, about to listen to a [PechaKucha talk][pechakucha] about the [Wonders of Wood][infoarticle]. I found out about it from a tweet by [@Richmond_BC]. I have no idea what [PechaKucha][pechakucha] is beyond the introductory paragraph in the [invitation article][infoarticle] which described it as a series of speakers presenting 20 slides for no more than 20 seconds.

<!-- more -->

My assumption was that it would be similar to a round of lightning talks- in tech circles that would mean about 30-40 minutes for 10 speaker. So I was surprised to be told this is a 3 hour event. So unfortunately I'll only be able to see the first speaker or two. 

Watching the slides going by right now as people drift in, there appears to be a depth and breadth of content to be presented that will easily fill the allotted time. And plenty of background conversations talking about various types of lumber.

And after four talks, or half the event, I had to go. 

But I did get to see a presentation by designers who had worked with, if memory serves, the Canadian Wood Council to show wood can be used to build six story buildings. They also highlighted it's inviting appearance and low cost. 

Then some amazing carvings by the [Richmond Carvers][RichmondCarvers]. 

This was followed by a personal talk by the founder of [Union Wood][UnionWood] about how wood connects the past with the present, with an interesting aside into being a garbage man.

The last talk I got to see was by zoologist Hugh Griffith that explored non-human users of wood- insects, birds, and animals.

[Pecha Kucha][pechakucha] is a great template and [Pecha Kucha Richmond][PkRichmond] has a pool of talented presenters. Now I understand the format I'll be prepared for next time!
