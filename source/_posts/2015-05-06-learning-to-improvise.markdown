One of the things being a Maker has taught me is how to improvise. Accidents happen, tools break, materials donâ€™t work, and you have to learn to find other routes to achieve your goal. Here is one example. My mother was turning 70 and the boys and I wanted to make her a Whopper Cake, [based on this book.](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/916684.Whopper_Cake)

I made two layers of the cake ahead of time, but then the night before the big party as I was making the final layer my electric hand beater broke! Not to give up, I asked Julian to come help with his drill.

The cake was a big success and we had fun surprising my Mom with it. Here is Tristan helping ice the cake, and the finished product. Making can be tasty!
