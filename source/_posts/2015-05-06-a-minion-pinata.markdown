Xavier wanted a Minion Pi√±ata for his 4th Birthday party. I did check the local stores, but none were to be had, so I set about making one. My brother and I always made our own Pinatas for our birhtdays each year, so I have some experience in this area. I didn't even know they could be purchased until I was an adult.

I took two balloons and connected them with a tube shape of poster board. I then made a simple paper mache of flour and water and did several layers of newspaper on it all. The final touches were some tissue paper and printed eyes and mouth. And then my creation was smashed to pieces with glee by a pack of candy crazed four year olds.
