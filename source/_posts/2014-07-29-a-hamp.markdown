On the weekend we made a HAMP (High Air-flow/Manual Pump) home-made Nerf gun.

It's based on [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oUIYxng9C8).

We couldn't get the same bushings that he used. But we found enough pieces at our local Rona to put it all together.

It works pretty well. The range is good, but some darts get stuck.
