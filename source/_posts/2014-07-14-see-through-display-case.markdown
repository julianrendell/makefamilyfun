My employer sometimes get's development prototypes of new displays for retail use- and sometimes the manufacturer doesn't want it back.

<!-- more -->

I was very lucky to get this- it's I vertical display case with a transparent LCD monitor on the front. You can show the 3D virtual model floating in front of the printer as it works. Even luckier- our Huxley just fits. Next step: install the printer and ruggedize it so that it can be taken to Sarah's school, and the kids.

Only small downside- replaces the cabinet I'd built a few wweeks ago.

(Note: the image doesn't do it justice- the lighting is very bright and my phone struggled to capture the full dynamic range.)
