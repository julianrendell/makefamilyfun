So what do you do when you find an advertising flag pole in the scrap metal yard? Take it home and turn it into a clothesline, right?

The smell of freshly dried laundry can't be beat. It makes the effort of mixing up a lot more concrete than I expected worth it. Not to mention the "maybe this wasn't a good idea" thoughts as I drove home with the pole tied to the top of the car and the wind started to catch it as I drove past the airport!
