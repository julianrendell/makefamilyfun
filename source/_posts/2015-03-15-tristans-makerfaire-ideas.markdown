Here is some stuff we will most likely be bringing to Maker Faire.

 The benefit of moding Nerf guns is that they shoot further, are easier to use and it is often fun to mod them.

Here is is a picture of a replica infinity blade from the game Infinity Blade 1. It was made using wood, a dremel and some paint. It was cut out using a saw and then sanded down with the dremel. It was made for Halloween, one week before the 31st. It looks good at a disctance. The handle was wrapped with E-tape to simulate leather.

Here is a picture of a shield that I made at Academy Duello. It was made from wood, with leather for the handle and it was painted with watercolour paints.
