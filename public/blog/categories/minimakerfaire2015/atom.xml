Here is is a picture of a replica infinity blade from the game Infinity Blade 1. It was made using wood, a dremel and some paint. It was cut out using a saw and then sanded down with the dremel. It was made for Halloween, one week before the 31st. It looks good at a disctance. The handle was wrapped with E-tape to simulate leather.
