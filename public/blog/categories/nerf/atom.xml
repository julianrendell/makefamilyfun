<p> The benefit of moding Nerf guns is that they shoot further, are easier to use and it is often fun to mod them.</p>

<p>This is a modified electronic Nerf flywheel blaster. Modifications done to this blaster include: Motors replaced, wiring redone with solid core wiring, all locks were removed and the firing mechanism was lubricated.

Here is is a picture of a replica infinity blade from the game Infinity Blade 1. It was made using wood, a dremel and some paint. It was cut out using a saw and then sanded down with the dremel. It was made for Halloween, one week before the 31st. It looks good at a disctance. The handle was wrapped with E-tape to simulate leather.

Here is a picture of a shield that I made at Academy Duello. It was made from wood, with leather for the handle and it was painted with watercolour paints.</p>

On the weekend we made a HAMP (High Air-flow/Manual Pump) home-made Nerf gun.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oUIYxng9C8">this YouTube video</a>.</p>

<p>We couldn&rsquo;t get the same bushings that he used. But we found enough pieces at our local Rona to put it all together.</p>

<p>It works pretty well. The range is good, but some darts get stuck.</p>
