Continuing trends in building my own furniture and trying to be more healthy I&rsquo;ve built my own standing desk.</p>

<p>I rounded the corners so I don&rsquo;t gouge myself. Even painted it with polyureathene so it should survive the horrors of coffee mugs.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve manged to make some space in our house, and I needed to take a day off work. Thanks to the folks at Rona who pre-cut the surface plywood for me, I succeeded in measuring, cutting, and putting it all together inside a day.</p>

<p>My 6 year old has to share a room with his 2 year old brother- who'se fingers are notourious for going everywhere by themselves.</p>

<p>What to do?</p>

<p>Create his own private loft.</p>

<p>My iPad and Adobe sketch were very helpful in both figuring it out and convincing other family members that it would work out.</p>
