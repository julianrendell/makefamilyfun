    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you look around the internet you can find videos and articles describing various ways of making 3d printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and other computer controlled devices make sounds.</p>

<p>This goes back a long time- when I was in high-school, one of my friends used to make the Apple IIe drives play music.</p>

<p>Most of these techniques involve moving a part of the machine rapidly back-and-forward hundreds to thousands of times a second.</p>

<p>For a well built, sturdy machine, there&rsquo;s probably no harm.</p>

<p>Then again, those Apple IIe&rsquo;s often seemed to have failing drives&hellip;</p>

<p>But did you know that many 3D Printers include a buzzer?</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M300:_Play_beep_sound"><code>M300</code></a> command.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have the printer play a tune when it&rsquo;s finished?</p>

<p>But what to do - it&rsquo;s a bit hard to figure out how to write music out as combinations of frequency and duration.</p>

<p>Luckily there are some standard ways of storing musical data, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a>, and we can write a program to convert from that to <code>M300</code> commands.</p>

<p>MIDI records music as a note number and a relative duration. So converting the timing of the notes is going to be pretty easy: <code>MIDI Duration * time per beat = M300 duration</code>.</p>

<p>The note numbers represent octave and regualar &ldquo;C, D, E, F, G, A, B&rdquo; notes.</p>

<p>We need a way of converting from these octave/notes to a frequency (how many times the speaker will move per second).</p>

<p>A couple of facts that will help us:</p>

<ul>
<li>Going from a lower note to the same note one octave higher means a doubling in frequency</li>
<li>there are 12 notes per octice (including sharps and flats)</li>
<li>most tunings are based on &lsquo;Concert A&rsquo; which is the A above Middle C</li>
<li>concert A is defined as being 440Hz</li>
<li>MIDI represents concert A as not number 69</li>
</ul>


<p>If you combine all of these together, you&rsquo;ll get a formula like:</p>

<p><code>freq = 440 * 2^((n-69)/12)</code></p>

<p>(I admit- I cheated a bit, and found this <a href="http://www.dzone.com/snippets/midi-note-number-and-frequency">Python snippet</a>.)</p>

<p>So now we have some rules, or formulae, that will let us convert from MIDI note number/duration pairs to <code>M300</code> g-code commands.</p>

<p>But how do we read the MIDI data.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for message in track:
...     if message.type == 'note_on':
...             if message.time &gt; 0:
...                     print "M300 S%d S%d" % (440.0*pow(2.0, ((message.note - 69.0) / 12.0)), message.time * 10)
</code></pre>

Finally plugged my Kinect into my computer to try <a href="http://skanect.occipital.com/">Skanect</a>. It&rsquo;s really cool, and amazingly, it&rsquo;s almost as easy to use as their web page makes it out to be.  The one difficulty I encountered was Tristan&rsquo;s dark hair; the sensor kept loosing tracking on the back of his head. Next time, better lighting!</p>

<p>Then some fun with <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">Meshlab</a>- removing the head from this model of a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7202">wizzard on Thingiverse</a> and glueing on Tristan&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Though in my excitement I made a key mistake- see if you can spot it.</p>

3D prints don&rsquo;t always work out. But with a little super glue and imagination you can turn them into something fun- like this. Looks a little <a href="http://sydmead.com/v/12/">Syd Meid</a> inspired.</p>

My employer sometimes get&rsquo;s development prototypes of new displays for retail use- and sometimes the manufacturer doesn&rsquo;t want it back. I was very lucky to get this- it&rsquo;s I vertical display case with a transparent LCD monitor on the front. You can show the 3D virtual model floating in front of the printer as it works. Even luckier- our Huxley just fits. Next step: install the printer and ruggedize it so that it can be taken to Sarah&rsquo;s school, and the kids.</p>

<p>Only small downside- replaces the cabinet I&rsquo;d built a few wweeks ago.</p>

<p>(Note: the image doesn&rsquo;t do it justice- the lighting is very bright and my phone struggled to capture the full dynamic range.)</p>

We want to be able to easily move our 3D printer around, including taking it to events and schools.</p>

<p>Thus was born the printer case.  Very nice that everything could be cut out of a single 4&#8217;x4&#8217; sheet of particle board.</p>

<p>Only downside- disconnecting everything and rewiring it with plugs. So many wires to solder!</p>
