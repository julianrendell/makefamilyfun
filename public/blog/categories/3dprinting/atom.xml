My employer sometimes get&rsquo;s development prototypes of new displays for retail use- and sometimes the manufacturer doesn&rsquo;t want it back. I was very lucky to get this- it&rsquo;s I vertical display case with a transparent LCD monitor on the front. You can show the 3D virtual model floating in front of the printer as it works. Even luckier- our Huxley just fits. Next step: install the printer and ruggedize it so that it can be taken to Sarah&rsquo;s school, and the kids.</p>

<p>Only small downside- replaces the cabinet I&rsquo;d built a few wweeks ago.</p>

<p>(Note: the image doesn&rsquo;t do it justice- the lighting is very bright and my phone struggled to capture the full dynamic range.)</p>

We want to be able to easily move our 3D printer around, including taking it to events and schools.</p>

<p>Thus was born the printer case.  Very nice that everything could be cut out of a single 4'x4' sheet of particle board.</p>

<p>Only downside- disconnecting everything and rewiring it with plugs. So many wires to solder!</p>

Got <a href="http://octoprint.org/">Octoprint</a> running on <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv5/seagate-dockstar">Arch for the Seagate Dockster</a>.</p>

<p>Now the printer can be completely remote controlled and monitored- Octoprint includes instructions for setting up a webcam to both record and stream the print.</p>

One of the problems of Bowden drives is that the PTFE (teflon) tube is hard to hold onto.</p>

<p>Added a larger PTFE tube (thanks Tiago!) and a new pressfit fitting. So far so good.</p>

We have a large wall mounted display at the office that is intended to display the status of various systems.  We&rsquo;ve yet to find a great app that is both informative and keeps people checking on it.</p>

<p>We tried <a href="http://skahal.com/buildron/">Buildron</a> but after a while it crashes and needs to be restarted.  And I never could get the Gravatar integration to work.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve decided to build our own information radiator utilising a Pandaboard we have in the office. We&rsquo;ve got Android on it, and Leslie has got a demo unity app to install and run.</p>

<p>To house this I build a wooden frame.  The back houses speakers, amplifier, Pandaboard, and an Arduino.  The Arduino controls 8 RGB LEDs embedded in the side of the frame. Long term we plan to have the Pandaboard send control messages to the Arduino that will trigger different LED sequences. Eg failing builds &ndash; shades of red.</p>

<p>The Pandaboard is held in place by a custom 3D clip that I created in OpenSCAD and printed. Right now everything else is held by tape, but they&rsquo;ll get 3D printed holders to.</p>

<p>I put to use the foam cutter I made from a broken toaster to cut out our team name from styrofoam. The acid etched look was achieved by using a couple of different kinds of spray paint. Solvent based spray paint dissolves styrofoam, whereas acrylic based doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
