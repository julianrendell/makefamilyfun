    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love wood. I love warm sunsets. I love being near water. And it&rsquo;s all better when in a beautiful heritage building with glittering live classical guitar.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in the Chinese Bunkhouse at the Britannia Shipyards National Historic Site, about to listen to a <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/">PechaKucha talk</a> about the <a href="http://www.richmond.ca/newsevents/city/DiscoverTheWondersOfWoodAtPechaKuchaRichmond.htm">Wonders of Wood</a>. I found out about it from a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/richmond_bc">@Richmond_BC</a>. I have no idea what <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/">PechaKucha</a> is beyond the introductory paragraph in the <a href="http://www.richmond.ca/newsevents/city/DiscoverTheWondersOfWoodAtPechaKuchaRichmond.htm">invitation article</a> which described it as a series of speakers presenting 20 slides for no more than 20 seconds.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My assumption was that it would be similar to a round of lightning talks- in tech circles that would mean about 30-40 minutes for 10 speaker. So I was surprised to be told this is a 3 hour event. So unfortunately I&rsquo;ll only be able to see the first speaker or two.</p>

<p>Watching the slides going by right now as people drift in, there appears to be a depth and breadth of content to be presented that will easily fill the allotted time. And plenty of background conversations talking about various types of lumber.</p>

<p>And after four talks, or half the event, I had to go.</p>

<p>But I did get to see a presentation by designers who had worked with, if memory serves, the Canadian Wood Council to show wood can be used to build six story buildings. They also highlighted it&rsquo;s inviting appearance and low cost.</p>

<p>Then some amazing carvings by the <a href="http://richmondcarvers.com/">Richmond Carvers</a>.</p>

<p>This was followed by a personal talk by the founder of <a href="http://www.unionwoodco.com/">Union Wood</a> about how wood connects the past with the present, with an interesting aside into being a garbage man.</p>

<p>The last talk I got to see was by zoologist Hugh Griffith that explored non-human users of wood- insects, birds, and animals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/">Pecha Kucha</a> is a great template and <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/cities/richmond-bc">Pecha Kucha Richmond</a> has a pool of talented presenters. Now I understand the format I&rsquo;ll be prepared for next time!</p>

    <link href="http://www.makefamilyfun.ca/blog/2015/05/08/crash-course-in-amazon-associate-links/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-08T17:25:13-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.makefamilyfun.ca/blog/2015/05/08/crash-course-in-amazon-associate-links</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve spent some time this week learning about <a href="https://associates.amazon.ca">Amazon&rsquo;s Associate</a> (affiliates) program. There&rsquo;s a lot of information scattered around the internet covering strategies to maximize revenues, or how to integrate it into various blogging engines, but I couldn&rsquo;t find much that gave an overview of how it all works, especially when considering the different regional Amazon stores.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my attempt at explaining it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are a few complications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon operates in multiple regions.</li>
<li>User accounts are per region, and per subsidiary; they are not global. e.g. Amazon US and Audible US both have associate programs, but require separate sign up. (More confusing given that you can login to Audible using your Amazon account!)</li>
<li>An Associate account is a regular account that has opted into the associate program.</li>
<li>Amazon pays associates by Amazon Gift Cards, direct deposit to a bank account (but only in the region of a given Amazon store), or by check. They all have minimum payout thresholds, generally $10. Checks incur a $15 fee. Associates can opt to set a higher minimum payout threshold.</li>
<li>Amazon has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">&ldquo;Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs)&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">ASINs</a> are unique, but not guaranteed to be the same across Amazon stores for a given product.</li>
<li>Amazon associate links that you create have to contain two key pieces of information: a special token that identifies the associate, and the ASIN of the product being promoted.</li>
<li>Associates can create as many tokens as they want to. This can be used to correlate earnings to different campaigns, or promotions, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>So when a visitor clicks on your associate link they&rsquo;ll end up on one of Amazon&rsquo;s sites.  If that person is already logged in, and has an account on the same Amazon site that your associate account belongs to then all is well: they&rsquo;ll end up on the product page you intended, and if they purchase the item you&rsquo;ll get a percentage.</p>

<p>But if the visitors account is with a different regional store, it will know that your token is not valid for that region and ignore it.  If the user purchases the item you won&rsquo;t get anything.</p>

<p>Worse, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">ASIN</a> you obtained from your Amazon regional store may not match the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">ASIN</a> of the product in your visitors regional store. I&rsquo;m not sure what happens in this case; it&rsquo;s not clear if the visitor ends up on a different (or non existent) product page or if Amazon does some cross-region <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">ASIN</a> matching magic. Whatever happens, you are not going to get any payment.</p>

<p>So if you know your site is regularly visited by people in several regions you need to sign up for accounts in each region, then opt in to each regions associate program. You also need to get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">ASIN</a> for the product in each region. Finally you need to add links for each region to your site.</p>

<p>But now you&rsquo;re going to be presenting your site&rsquo;s visitors with a bevy of Amazon links, and if they click on the wrong one you still won&rsquo;t earn anything.</p>

<p>There is a thread of hope- in general the physical location of the browser will match the correct region for the Amazon store of the visitor.</p>

<p>Javascript can be used to geo-locate the IP address of the browser (for example <a href="https://github.com/onury/geolocator">geolocator</a>) so in principle you could build a script that determines the visitors location and substitutes your associate token for that region.</p>

<p>That takes care of the associate token&hellip; but not the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">ASIN</a>. We could look up the details of the product (using Amazon&rsquo;s product API) in the original region store and then apply some heuristics to find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">ASIN</a> in the visitor&rsquo;s region&rsquo;s store.</p>

<p>Javascript can do that too, right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately not. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">Same Origin Policy</a> get&rsquo;s in the way. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">SOP</a> is a security measure that only allows Javascript scripts to communicate with the server from which they were loaded.  There are work-arounds, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a>, but they require support from the API provider. Unfortunately Amazon doesn&rsquo;t support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> for their product API.</p>

<p>The only way to take care of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">ASIN</a> conversion is to have your javascript call back to your server, and then have your server figure out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number">ASIN</a> for the visitors region.  One implementation of such a proxy is this <a href="http://petewilliams.info/blog/2009/07/javascript-amazon-associate-link-localiser/">Amazon Associate Link Localiser</a> written in JavaScript and PHP.</p>

<p>This is why all the Amazon link localizers for CMSs have both a server-side part and some extra JavaScript.</p>

<p>Aside: I suspect that even after all the above, if someone is travelling outside of the region of their Amazon account the above will fail and again, you&rsquo;ll miss out on any potential revenue.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not a lot of use for this site.  Right now this site is being generated by <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. There are no server-side scripts; it&rsquo;s all static HTML pages pre-generated by the <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> script running on my computer.  This makes it easier (and cheaper) to find a host for, but precludes any server-side proxy. There are services, like <a href="http://www.georiot.com/home">GeoRiot</a>, that can take care of this for you, but I suspect they&rsquo;d cost us more than what we&rsquo;ll make via associate sales.</p>

<p>It does seem that Amazon is, shall we say, not maximizing associates potential revenue in a global economy.</p>

<p>The silver lining for us is that, at the time of writing this, most of our site visitors are from Canada. So one simple Amazon associate link will capture the majority of potential buyers we forward on.</p>

<p>Amazon product links can be added using Amazons <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/join/landing/tools.html">sitestripe</a>, but instead I&rsquo;m going to use this <a href="https://github.com/longkey1/jekyll-amazon-plugin">Jekyll amazon plugin</a>. This way there&rsquo;ll be less to do in the future if I do implement a server side proxy.</p>

One of the things being a Maker has taught me is how to improvise. Accidents happen, tools break, materials don’t work, and you have to learn to find other routes to achieve your goal. Here is one example. My mother was turning 70 and the boys and I wanted to make her a Whopper Cake, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/916684.Whopper_Cake">based on this book.</a>

I made two layers of the cake ahead of time, but then the night before the big party as I was making the final layer my electric hand beater broke! Not to give up, I asked Julian to come help with his drill.

<p>Xavier wanted a Minion Piñata for his 4th Birthday party. I did check the local stores, but none were to be had, so I set about making one. My brother and I always made our own Pinatas for our birhtdays each year, so I have some experience in this area. I didn&rsquo;t even know they could be purchased until I was an adult.</p>

<p>I took two balloons and connected them with a tube shape of poster board. I then made a simple paper mache of flour and water and did several layers of newspaper on it all. The final touches were some tissue paper and printed eyes and mouth. And then my creation was smashed to pieces with glee by a pack of candy crazed four year olds.</p>

When given a choice on how he wanted to present his learning, of course he chose to make something. 

With plaster of Paris and plasticine, this is what he came up with.

    <id>http://www.makefamilyfun.ca/blog/2014/08/02/printer-music</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you look around the internet you can find videos and articles describing various ways of making 3d printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and other computer controlled devices make sounds.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This goes back a long time- when I was in high-school, one of my friends used to make the Apple IIe drives play music.</p>

<p>Most of these techniques involve moving a part of the machine rapidly back-and-forward hundreds to thousands of times a second.</p>

<p>For a well built, sturdy machine, there&rsquo;s probably no harm.</p>

<p>Then again, those Apple IIe&rsquo;s often seemed to have failing drives&hellip;</p>

<p>But did you know that many 3D Printers include a buzzer?</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M300:_Play_beep_sound"><code>M300</code></a> command.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have the printer play a tune when it&rsquo;s finished?</p>

<p>But what to do - it&rsquo;s a bit hard to figure out how to write music out as combinations of frequency and duration.</p>

<p>Luckily there are some standard ways of storing musical data, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a>, and we can write a program to convert from that to <code>M300</code> commands.</p>

<p>MIDI records music as a note number and a relative duration. So converting the timing of the notes is going to be pretty easy: <code>MIDI Duration * time per beat = M300 duration</code>.</p>

<p>The note numbers represent octave and regualar &ldquo;C, D, E, F, G, A, B&rdquo; notes.</p>

<p>We need a way of converting from these octave/notes to a frequency (how many times the speaker will move per second).</p>

<p>A couple of facts that will help us:</p>

<ul>
<li>Going from a lower note to the same note one octave higher means a doubling in frequency</li>
<li>there are 12 notes per octice (including sharps and flats)</li>
<li>most tunings are based on &lsquo;Concert A&rsquo; which is the A above Middle C</li>
<li>concert A is defined as being 440Hz</li>
<li>MIDI represents concert A as not number 69</li>
</ul>


<p>If you combine all of these together, you&rsquo;ll get a formula like:</p>

<p><code>freq = 440 * 2^((n-69)/12)</code></p>

<p>(I admit- I cheated a bit, and found this <a href="http://www.dzone.com/snippets/midi-note-number-and-frequency">Python snippet</a>.)</p>

<p>So now we have some rules, or formulae, that will let us convert from MIDI note number/duration pairs to <code>M300</code> g-code commands.</p>

<p>But how do we read the MIDI data.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&gt;&gt;&gt; for message in track:
</span><span class='line'>...     if message.type == 'note_on':
</span><span class='line'>...             if message.time &gt; 0:
</span><span class='line'>...                     print "M300 S%d S%d" % (440.0*pow(2.0, ((message.note - 69.0) / 12.0)), message.time * 10)
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oUIYxng9C8">this YouTube video</a>.</p>

<p>We couldn&rsquo;t get the same bushings that he used. But we found enough pieces at our local Rona to put it all together.</p>

<p>It works pretty well. The range is good, but some darts get stuck.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a term that comes up a lot in 3D printing. Non-manifold models cause a lot of problems and lead to failed prints.</p>

<p>You often hear it being described in terms of &ldquo;water tightness&rdquo;, but that hasn&rsquo;t helped me to understand it.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://www.iheartrobotics.com/2010/01/openscad-tip-manifold-space-and-time.html">this</a> post did, especially <a href="http://www.iheartrobotics.com/2010/01/openscad-tip-manifold-space-and-time.html?showComment=1264551125102#c7892813172347887917">this comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dominic Muren said&hellip;
While &ldquo;watertightness&rdquo; is a nice by-product of a manifold mesh, the real test of whether a mesh is manifold or not is that all edges must be shared by exactly two polygons (usually triangles). If we think about a hole (or a leak, in terms of watertightness) that would be a triangle with an edge used by only one polygon. But another way to make a non-manifold, but still technically watertight mesh is to take a manifold mesh and connect two arbitrary edges with a triangle &ndash; that would create at least one edge shared by three polygons.</p>

<p>nd outside are, if there are multiple volumes enclosed by meshes.</p>

<p>In this case, it looks like you might have had an errant triangle, or an edge that didn&rsquo;t terminate correctly, because of how many edges shared that upper vertex. Making the step freed the vertex up.</p></blockquote>

<p>Extra: technically we want models to be 2-manifold.</p>

Finally plugged my Kinect into my computer to try <a href="http://skanect.occipital.com/">Skanect</a>. It&rsquo;s really cool, and amazingly, it&rsquo;s almost as easy to use as their web page makes it out to be.</p>

<p>The one difficulty I encountered was Tristan&rsquo;s dark hair; the sensor kept loosing tracking on the back of his head. Next time, better lighting!</p>

<p>Then some fun with <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">Meshlab</a>- removing the head from this model of a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7202">wizzard on Thingiverse</a> and glueing on Tristan&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Though in my excitement I made a key mistake- see if you can spot it.</p>

3D prints don&rsquo;t always work out. But with a little super glue and imagination you can turn them into something fun- like this. Looks a little <a href="http://sydmead.com/v/12/">Syd Meid</a> inspired.</p>

My employer sometimes get&rsquo;s development prototypes of new displays for retail use- and sometimes the manufacturer doesn&rsquo;t want it back.</p>

<p>I was very lucky to get this- it&rsquo;s I vertical display case with a transparent LCD monitor on the front. You can show the 3D virtual model floating in front of the printer as it works. Even luckier- our Huxley just fits. Next step: install the printer and ruggedize it so that it can be taken to Sarah&rsquo;s school, and the kids.</p>

<p>Only small downside- replaces the cabinet I&rsquo;d built a few wweeks ago.</p>

<p>(Note: the image doesn&rsquo;t do it justice- the lighting is very bright and my phone struggled to capture the full dynamic range.)</p>

So what do you do when you find an advertising flag pole in the scrap metal yard? Take it home and turn it into a clothesline, right?</p>

<p>The smell of freshly dried laundry can&rsquo;t be beat. It makes the effort of mixing up a lot more concrete than I expected worth it. Not to mention the &ldquo;maybe this wasn&rsquo;t a good idea&rdquo; thoughts as I drove home with the pole tied to the top of the car and the wind started to catch it as I drove past the airport!</p>

<p>Thus was born the printer case.  Very nice that everything could be cut out of a single 4&#8217;x4&#8217; sheet of particle board.</p>

<p>Only downside- disconnecting everything and rewiring it with plugs. So many wires to solder!</p>

<p>One of the problems of Bowden drives is that the PTFE (teflon) tube is hard to hold onto.</p>

<p>We tried <a href="http://skahal.com/buildron/">Buildron</a> but after a while it crashes and needs to be restarted.  And I never could get the Gravatar integration to work.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve decided to build our own information radiator utilising a Pandaboard we have in the office. We&rsquo;ve got Android on it, and Leslie has got a demo unity app to install and run.</p>

<p>To house this I build a wooden frame.  The back houses speakers, amplifier, Pandaboard, and an Arduino.  The Arduino controls 8 RGB LEDs embedded in the side of the frame. Long term we plan to have the Pandaboard send control messages to the Arduino that will trigger different LED sequences. Eg failing builds - shades of red.</p>

<p>The Pandaboard is held in place by a custom 3D clip that I created in OpenSCAD and printed. Right now everything else is held by tape, but they&rsquo;ll get 3D printed holders to.</p>

<p>I put to use the foam cutter I made from a broken toaster to cut out our team name from styrofoam. The acid etched look was achieved by using a couple of different kinds of spray paint. Solvent based spray paint dissolves styrofoam, whereas acrylic based doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
